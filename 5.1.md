The mirror layed tucked away in the corner of the bedroom, worn by time, small and unobtrusive. A ray of light shot through the trees outside the window reflecting on the mirror's faded glas. Two men dressed in somber black coats stood before the night table. The shorter man knelt hesitantly to look closer.

"This shouldn't be here," Harry reflected aloud, "it doesn't make sense." Harry turned to the taller man, smoke from his cigarret creating a cloud. The taller man tried to suppress a cough with no success, "How so?". Harry turned to the mirror, "Well, for starters..." Harry moved his head closer and blew away the smoke pointing at the mirror. "this inscript". The taller man leaned in and tried to see what Harry was pointing at. "What about it?". Harry rose carefully, taking the mirror with him. "Do you know anything about the Aymara's?" Harry asked while taking a seat in a dusty chair in the opposite corner of the room. The tall man thought for a while, "No, nothing". "Well, " Harry said while making marks in the thick layer of dust on the arm of the chair, "they are a tribe. South American. A small tribe that later became a subject of the Incas." Harry stopped drawing and focused on the mirror. "The use of mirrors in Aymaran culture, and other Mesoamerican cultures, was associated with the notion of portals." "Portals?" the taller man asked with a suspicios look. "Yeah, the Aymaran's believed they served as portals to a realm that could be seen but not interacted with." The tall man snorted, "Common superstition"
